# Simple Web Browser
I am attempting a simple web browser using the QT6 framework. This is a fun project to have a go at parsing HTML and CSS. Current progress is setting up the Qt framework for the window.

## Build Steps
The current build procedure for Linux:
`mkdir build`
`./build.sh -configure`
`./build.sh -run`
